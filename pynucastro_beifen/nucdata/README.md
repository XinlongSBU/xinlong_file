# Binding Energy Tables

Included here are tables of binding energy per nucleon in MeV for
nuclides specified by (N, Z).

The data for these tables is derived from the Atomic Mass Evaluations
2012 and 2016. By default, pynucastro uses Atomic Mass Evaluation
2016. Scripts for reading the Atomic Mass Evaluation tables,
citations, and links for the tables are provided in the
`AtomicMassEvaluation` directory.
