# Fortran VODE Integration

Included are a set of template files for generating a Fortran network
integrator using the VODE implicit integration scheme. The integrator
evolves species mass fractions and energy generation. No external
libraries are necessary to integrate a network thus generated.

Plotting functionality is provided by the python scripts plot_rates.py
and plot_abundances.py. Additional python scripts are provided for
sanity checks and table introspection.
